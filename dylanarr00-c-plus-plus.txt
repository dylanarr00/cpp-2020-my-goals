What I would like to take from this class is the ablility to make my own creations and tweak them to my liking but also be able to work for a good paying company. Maybe even start my own business with software I create. I have learned the basics of how to kind of put code in order, but I don't really have any hands on experience with coding. I hope that this class will also teach me a bit about all the other languages
